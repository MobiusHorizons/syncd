# Building

You will need `libcurl` and `json-c` development libraries installed. 

Then run these commands from the checked out folder.

    ./autogen.sh #build the configure script.
    ./configure
    make
    sudo make install.


# Running

Once you have built and installed **syncd**, you will need to create a rules file.

This file should be located in the syncd config directory at `$HOME/.config/syncd/rules.json`.
This is a json formatted file specifying where to copy files to/from.

The format of this file is as follows:

    { 
        "plugin:///src/folder/" : [ "plugin:///dest/1/", "plugin:///dest/2/"],
        "dropbox:///Documents/" : [ "fs:///home/user/Documents/"]
    }

The current plugin prifixes are 
- `dropbox://` for dropbox
- `fs://` for the filesystem
- `gdrive://` for Google Drive
